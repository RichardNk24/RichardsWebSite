                    <p class="skill-p">I have been evolving in the tech world since late 2014 when I enroll in my Bachelor of Computer Science degree and  I started writing code in the Front End Development by using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, firstly for educational reasons, then for personal ambition and projects. Couple of months later other students contacted me in order to get their tasks and jobs done and offer to pay me. That’s how and when the journey began. 
                        Today, skills that practice on a daily basis taught me in Front End Development are, Just to name a few, frameworks like REACT, VUE.JS, Node.JS and Bootstrap.</p>

                    <p>Agile teams use “just enough” planning and an incremental approach to accomplishing the work of the team. Every project and every team uses a custom agile methodology. If you ask my brain what it can tell you about management it is actually common foundational principles and practices used by agile methodologies, providing you a flexible set of tools to use in any role (e.g. product owner, scrum master, project manager, team member) on any agile team. This course mainly discusses agile and lean principles, the kanban and scrum agile methodologies, and uses Atlassian Jira Software Cloud as the main software tool to apply hands-on learning of the topics. The course includes instruction on "classic" Jira projects as well as the new "next-gen" Jira projects.

                        Students can use the free plan of Atlassian Jira Software Cloud to complete the hands-on labs associated with this course. By the time you have completed this course, you will have a strong foundational understanding of agile principles and practices, and strong hands-on experience with Atlassian Jira Software Cloud. You will be the site administrator for your Jira account, so you will be able to perform basic administration tasks on your site. You should be able to continuously configure your Jira project(s) to match your team's custom agile methodology.</p>
